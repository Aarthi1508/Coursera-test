					<h2> PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) </h2>
					<div id="bg1"></div>
					<p>
						 This is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

						The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend battle life. When the player joins a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the play island. While the plane is flying over the island the player can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the player must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the player is to survive on an island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the player encounters along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

						Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold and elixir can be used to build and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player from other players' attacks and to build and uppgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. Gems are the premium currency.Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes. The game also features a pseudo-single-player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages and earn gold, elixir, and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only). The game starts with two builders, but the player can have up to five builders through buying them with gems and even a sixth by getting and unlocking the OTTO Hut in Builder Base 9.
